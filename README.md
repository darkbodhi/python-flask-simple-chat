# python-flask-simple-chat
One of the recent assignments I have completed. It is a super simple web-chat. It uses Flask framework for routing handling and MongoDB (mongoengine) for saving the history of dialogue. I've written models and rewritten most of the main file (I have used tutorials for chat creation from the Internet). However, the template is taken from one of such tutorial completely.
